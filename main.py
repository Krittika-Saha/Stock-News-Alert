## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

difference = abs(float(closing_price_yesterday) - float(closing_price_before_yesterday))
diff_percent = (difference/float(closing_price_yesterday)) * 100

if diff_percent > 5:
    print("Get News")

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
#HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.
